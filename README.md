# Cisco-BTL2

This is the description for Assignment 2 - Computer Networks - HCMUT

In this assignment, you are required to create a network for the hospital using Cisco Packet Tracer

In this project, I have implemented almost the requirements, include:

- Subnets for Main Site and 2 Auxiliary Sites
- Firewall to avoid intruders from outside the network (Integrate with NAT)
- Load Balancing
- DS - LAM

However, there are some other requirements that haven't been included in the file:

- VPN Configuration
- Surveillance camera for the whole system

The reference used to implement this project had been included in the report, you can observe it at the end of the report.

I was graded 9.5 for this assignment, by Mr. Th√¨n.

Good luck!
